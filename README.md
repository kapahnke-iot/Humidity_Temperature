# Humidity_Temperature
Code to measure humidity and temperature


I created the code for different sensors,  platforms and sometimes in multiple languages or frameworks, that is the reason why I use the following path structure to separate  them in this repository: `sensor_type/hardware_platform/language_framework`

sensor_type
   * `DHT22`
   
hardware_platform
   * pi
   * arduino
   * `esp8266`
   * photon 
 
 language_framework
   * appmit2inventor
   * `C-C++`
   * java
   * python
   * snap4arduino
   * ...
