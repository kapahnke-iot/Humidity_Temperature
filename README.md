# Humidity_Temperature
Code to measure humidity and temperature

I created the code for different platforms and sometimes in multiple languages or frameworks, that is the reason why I use the following path structure to separate  them in this repository: `hardware_platform/language_framwork`
   * pi
   * arduino
   * esp8266
   * photon
